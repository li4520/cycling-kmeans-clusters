# cycling-kmeans-clusters
* Dabbling in unsupervised learning with my cycling data.
** Data cleaning, import weather data, etc.
** Standardize data
** Use elbow method to determine the optimum clusters
* Cycling data exported from Garmin Connect. Data include outdoor rides and virtual rides (Zwift).
* Inspired by bunch of random Medium articles for unsupervised learning + kmeans algorithm.
