# cycling-kmeans-clusters
## Dabbling in unsupervised learning with my cycling data:
* Exported rides from Garmin Connect (outdoor and virtual rides from Zwift)
* Data cleaning, import weather data, etc.
* Standardize data for processing
* Use elbow method to determine the optimum clusters


Inspired by bunch of random Medium articles for unsupervised learning + kmeans algorithm.
