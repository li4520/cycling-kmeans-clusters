# cycling-kmeans-clusters
* Dabbling in unsupervised learning with my sample cycling data.
* Getting export from my garmin connect. 
* Going through the process of cleaning up CSV and make sure all data are in the right format. 
* Going through the steps of kmeans, using elbow method to determine optimum, and clusters. 
* Inspired by bunch of random Medium articles for unsupervised learning + kmeans algorithm.
